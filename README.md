# First_App - 28/11/2018

## Description
Its a Quiz App that has 7 questions with each having 4 possible answers. The App determines wether you got the right answer or not after 
choosing one and grants you a point if it was right. After answering all questions you will see your final score.


## How to play
The first screen has 2 possible buttons.
The first button "SPIELEN" starts the game and the second one "HIGHSCORE" is supposed to show all the previous highscores but i didn't 
program it.

1. By clicking "SPIELEN" you get to the first question with 4 randomly arranged answers and a little score display at the bottom 
   of the screen.
2. After clicking on one of the possible answers the algorithm determines wether it was right or wrong. In case you got the right
   answer you get a point and consequently no point for a wrong answer.
3. If you answered the last (7th) question you get to the "endscreen" which displays your final score at the center of the screen. 
4. To get back to the main menu you just click the button "STARTSEITE"
